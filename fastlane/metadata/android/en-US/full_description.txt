<p><i>Snapcast</i> is a <a href='https://github.com/badaix/snapcast' target='_blank'>Snapcast</a> control client and player for Android. It uses the <a href='https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/master/doc/json_rpc_api/v2_0_0.md' target='_blank'>Snapcast JSON-RPC API</a> to control your synchronous multi-room audio player.</p>
<p>This App is not meant for productive use and will only run when you have a Snapserver installed in your local network.</p>
<p><i>Snapcast</i> is a multi-room client-server audio player, where all clients are time synchronized with the server to play perfectly synced audio. It’s not a standalone player, but an extension that turns your existing audio player into a Sonos-like multi-room solution.</p>
<p>The server’s audio input is a named pipe <code>/tmp/snapfifo</code>. All data that is fed into this file will be send to the connected clients. One of the most generic ways to use Snapcast is in conjunction with the music player daemon (MPD) or Mopidy, which can be configured to use a named pipe as audio output.</p>
